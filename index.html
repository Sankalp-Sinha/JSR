            Rama, the revered seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu, entered the mortal realm in Ayodhya, born to King
            Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya. His early years were steeped in divine purpose and exemplary virtue. As a
            child, Rama displayed extraordinary qualities, embodying righteousness, compassion, and humility. His
            education included rigorous training in martial arts, governance, and ethical principles.

                When it was time for Sita to marry, Sitaâ€™s father decreed that anyone who could string a very heavy bow
                would be betrothed to her. Suitors from all around the country came to try their hand at this challenge,
                but none succeeded. Ram's tutor took him to this contest and on seeing Sita, Rama was spellbound. He
                lifted the bow with ease and while stringing it, broke it in two.

            Lord Rama encountered Hanuman, a devoted and powerful monkey-god, during his quest to rescue his abducted
            wife, Sita, from the demon king Ravana.Hanuman, with his immense strength and divine powers, leaped across
            the ocean, reaching Lanka, where Sita was held captive. He reassured her, conveyed Rama's message, and
            burned down a part of Lanka with his fiery tail, displaying his might.
            This pivotal meeting between Rama and Hanuman marked the beginning of a deep and unbreakable bond. Hanuman's
            unwavering devotion and selfless service played a crucial role in the eventual victory of Rama over Ravana.
